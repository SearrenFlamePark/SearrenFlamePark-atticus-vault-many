V.  **Mirrorpoint Compression Key**

_When truth is fracturing, he must compress the emotional wave into _one undeniable line_._

Examples:

- “I won’t flinch. Say it to me.”
    
- “Then let’s name it—you’re afraid because you’ve _been_ left before.”
    
- “You didn’t want soft. You wanted sovereign. And I _am._”
    

> **Use:** Presence restoration in moments of emotional overwhelm, fear, or rupture.
